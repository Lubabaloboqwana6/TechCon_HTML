        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          TechCon began as a small, local gathering of technology enthusiasts in
          2005. Conceived by a group of visionary technologists, the first
          conference aimed to create a space where professionals could share
          knowledge, discuss emerging trends, and foster innovation. With just a
          few hundred attendees, the inaugural event set the foundation for what
          would become a significant platform in the tech world.
